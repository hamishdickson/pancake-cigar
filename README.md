pancake-cigar
=============

An attempt to model something Freeman Dyson said (I've attempted  to find the paper, but I guess it's classified - which is fair enough really, it's to do with shaped nuclear weapons):

* if you have a pancake shaped explosion, it will expand out in a cigar shape
* if you have a cigar shaped explosion, it will expand out in a pancake shape

If you'd like to know more, I guess you should model it... having said that I found out about this in a book called Project Orion, the Atomic Spaceship 1957-1965 by George Dyson - it's an excellent book, try and read it if you can find a copy.
